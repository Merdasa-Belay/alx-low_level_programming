File: 0-main.c, main.h In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
File: 1-main.c This program prints the largest of three integers.That’s definitely not right.Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.Line count will not be checked for this task.
File: 2-largest_number.c, main.h This program prints the largest of three integers.
